# Text Adventure Game Development

This project is a text-based adventure game inspired by classic storytelling elements and designed with Python fundamentals. It incorporates essential programming concepts, such as:

- Strings and String Manipulation
- User-Defined Functions and Variables
- User Input and Input Handling
- Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements
- Loops (for/while)
- Error Handling with try/except

## Project Requirements
- Based on an adaptation of a book, movie, or TV show.
- Designed to be completed within 3 minutes.
- Includes 3 stages, with defined variables, lists, loops, and conditional statements.
- Features a win and fail function for ending the game based on user actions.

## Deliverables
- Python code in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` format)
- HTML version of the notebook for easy access and sharing

## Key Highlights
- Error-free, optimized gameplay with a focus on user experience and replayability.
- Designed for educational purposes, showcasing best practices in Python programming for interactive applications.

## Repository Files
- `pulp_fiction_game.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the game.
- `pulp_fiction_game.html`: HTML export of the notebook.
